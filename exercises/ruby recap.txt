1) Can you explain the ||= operator?
Example of use:
  a = 1
  b = 2
  a ||= b  (Hint! Same as: a = a || b)

One more example of use:
  c = nil
  d = 40
  c ||= d  (Hint! Same as: c = c || d)

Conditional Assignments, if a is empty, assign the value to a, otherwise a retains its value



2) Define a Hash with keys "a", "b", "c", "d", and values ["avocado"], ["bean", "banana"], ["carrot", "cherry", "clementine"] and ["date", "dragon fruit"] respectively.
Then:
a) print the hash to the console
b) find a way to print the total number of fruits. It should give you number 9.
c) remove all "c" fruits
d) print the hash again

b)
hash.each do |k,v|
  print v
end

c)
total = 0
hash.each do |k,v|
  total += v.count
end

d)



3) Let's say we have the following array:
codes = [65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70]
What ruby code do we have to call, to change this array into ["A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F"]?
Hint! Look for ruby method called #chr.

.chr

4) Having a following array:
chars = ["a", "K", "r", "e", "V", "L", "C"]
Iterate over the array, or use map method, to print following:
irb(main):046:0> ... your code ...
- a is lowercase
- K is uppercase
- r is lowercase
- e is lowercase
- V is uppercase
- L is uppercase
- C is uppercase
=> nil



5) How are the methods ending with exclamation mark different? You can explain on the following example:
str1 = "MY STRING"
str1.downcase
str1.downcase!

Permanent assignment

6) Write a method that receives a positive number. If the number:
- is between 1 and 5, method prints "I am between 1 and 5".
- is between 6 and 10, method prints "I am between 6 and 10"
- otherwise, method prints "I am more than 10"

def positive(num)
  if (num > 0 && num < 6)
    print "I am between 1 and 5"
  elsif (num > 5 & num < 11)
    print "I am between 6 and 10"
  else
    print "I am more than 10"
end



7) Write a method that will change Celsius to Fahrenheit.
Hint! If you call method with 30 Celsius, you should get back 86 Fahrenheit.

def celtofah(cel)
  fal = (cel * 1.8)+32
end
