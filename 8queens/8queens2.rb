The n-queens puzzle is the problem of placing n queens on an nÃ—n chessboard such that no
two queens attack each other.

Given an integer n, return all distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle.

Each solution contains a distinct board configuration of the n-queens' placement,
where 'Q' and '.' both indicate a queen and an empty space respectively.

2 boards -> 1 keep track
keep track of all invalid moves
keep track of previous queen
brute force!!

Variables
N for boardsize and number of queens


methods:
generateboard -> convert all to .
place queen -> select a dot
